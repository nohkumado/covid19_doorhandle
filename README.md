# covid19_doorhandle

inspired by  https://www.materialise.com/en/hands-free-door-opener but i am
using openscad, plus i needed to adapt it to my doorhandles

rationale: places where people get in and out frequently, everyone touches the
doorhandle, even with appropriated metallic coating of certain sorts (copper,
silver etc) the handle is able to desinfect itself in a minimum time of 10 min,
if passage is more often, lets try to not let the handle be touched then.

Here comes this design, instead of using the hand, the forearm is used to make
lever on the handle and to pull the door closed (if you need to push, you can
also use more easily your body).
